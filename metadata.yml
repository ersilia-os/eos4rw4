Title: Continuous and data-driven descriptor (CDDD)
Description: Low dimension continuous descriptor based on a neural machine translation
  model. This model has been trained by inputting a IUPAC molecular representaion
  to obtain its SMILES. Tthe intermediate continuous vector representation encoded
  by when reading the IUPAC name is a representation of the molecule, containing all
  the information to generate the output sequence (SMILES). This model has been pretrained
  on a large dataset combining ChEMBL and ZINC, and embedded in ONNX format for ease
  of use
