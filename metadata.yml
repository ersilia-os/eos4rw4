Title: Continuous and data-driven descriptor (CDDD)
Description: Low dimension continuous descriptor based on a neural machine 
  translation model. This model has been trained by inputting a IUPAC molecular 
  representaion to obtain its SMILES. Tthe intermediate continuous vector 
  representation encoded by when reading the IUPAC name is a representation of 
  the molecule, containing all the information to generate the output sequence 
  (SMILES). This model has been pretrained on a large dataset combining ChEMBL 
  and ZINC, and embedded in ONNX format for ease of use
